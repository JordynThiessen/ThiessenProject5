            <h2>Information About Me</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 2;"> Hello my name is Jordyn Thiessen and I am currently a Junior at Northwest Missouri State University. I am a Interactive Digital Media Major in the Visual Imaging branch. I am creating this website for my Web Development I course, I am sharing a hobby of mine that I started doing during Quarantine during this Pandemic. This hobby is piecing together Metal Models that come together as miniture scluptures. The brand I put together is Metal Earth and they have loads of models you could comeplete yourself.</p>
            <p style="line-height: 2;">I have many hobbies such as reading, painting and traveling. But metal models have become a favorite of mine, they are fun and easy for me to complete. Then when you're done you have something cool to show people.</p>
